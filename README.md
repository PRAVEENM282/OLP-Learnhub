# LearnHub
A full-stack Online Learning Platform using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) enabling students to enroll in courses, teachers to manage content, and admins to oversee activity. Features include authentication, progress tracking, certification, paid/free courses, and a responsive UI.
📚 Online Learning Platform using MERN
This project is a full-fledged Online Learning Platform (OLP) developed using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It aims to replicate the functionality of popular e-learning systems by providing a dynamic and interactive environment for students, teachers, and administrators.

👨‍🏫 Overview
The platform allows teachers to create, manage, and update online courses with multiple sections, while students can register, browse courses by category or name, enroll in free or paid courses, and track their learning progress. Upon completion of a course, students can download a certificate of completion. An admin oversees the platform, managing users and courses, and maintaining the integrity of the system.
